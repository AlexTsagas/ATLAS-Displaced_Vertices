# Project - In Search for Displaced Vertices

## Goal of Project

The purpose of the project is to find long lived particles/Displaved Vertices (DVs) which are depicted as points where
trajectories of its products (stable particles) converge. To specify, two points that belong the trajectories are given.
The DVs are calculated as follows:

## Event Proccessing

### Events with One DV

  * The trajectories that lead us to it need to be "close together". So, we choose the closest trajectories of the event
    to calculate the DV.

  * Then, we define the DV as the midpoint of the distance vector of the closest trajectories. Also, in order to narrow the
    false positives an "if statement" is used to exclude some points. The requirement for a point P to be calculated from line_i 
    and line_j is the vectors: PA_i, PB_i, and PA_j, PB_j to create an angle less or equal than Ï€/2, where A and B are the begin and
    end points of each line. The distance between the real DV and the recommended is presented as error in histogram.

  * Furthemore, to procces events with more than one DV the closest distance of DV to the third trajectory of every event is calculated.
    The histogram produced by the results offers information about the cases that must be considered. To take them into account an 
    "if statement" should be used that would count trajectories which belong to the same DV but are not used to construct it.
  
### Events with Multiple DVs

  * The first step is to specify the number of DVs that exists in every event. Thus, the goal is to find the DV_reco(mmended) with the 
    most accurate approximation possible. When the total number of DV_reco is calculated, the code produces histograms that compare it
    with the total number of real DVs (DV_true).

  * For every DV_reco calculated, two trajectories are used:
      * those that are closest together and construct the DV_reco, and
      * those which respect the "if statement" of relative angles mentioned in the previous paragraph. 
    Then, an if statement is used to exclude more trajectories that might belong to the same DV_reco, using an upper bound for the distance
    between them and the DV_reco. If another DV_reco exists in the same event, we exclude the previous trajectories used and we search the
    other with the remaining ones. To continue searching for DVs the algorith checks:
      * if there is a sufficient number of trajectories left to construct a DV (more than 2), and
      * the minimum distance of the closest trajectories remaining unused (check for minimum distances lower than an upper bound).

  * The error between the DV_true and DV_reco is defined as the distance between them. For the first calculated DV_reco of an event 
    every possible error with DV_trues is computed and, then, the minimum is picked to represent the value. Then, the DV_true used to 
    calculate the error of the first DV_reco is excluded. The same proccess is repeated to compute the other DV_reco's errors (if they exist).
